# Cordyline Smart Account

![](./img/cordyline-account.jpg)

A set of lightweight ERC-4337 compatible smart contract accounts with designated ownership.

Cordyline Smart Account is inspired in [Light-Account](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/light-account) but focused in Entrypoint v0.8 and Polygon Chain.

## Features

### `CordylineAccount`

Like [eth-infinitism](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction)'s [`SimpleAccount`](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/develop/contracts/samples/SimpleAccount.sol), but with the following changes:

1. Instead of the default storage slots, uses namespaced storage to avoid clashes when switching implementations.

2. Ownership can be transferred via `transferOwnership`, similar to the behavior of an `Ownable` contract. This is a simple single-step operation, so care must be taken to ensure that the ownership is being transferred to the correct address.

3. Supports [ERC-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) signature validation for both validating the signature on user operations and in exposing its own `isValidSignature` method. This only works when the owner of `CordylineAccount` also support ERC-1271.

   _ERC-4337's bundler validation rules limit the types of contracts that can be used as owners to validate user operation signatures. For example, the contract's `isValidSignature` function may not use any forbidden opcodes such as `TIMESTAMP` or `NUMBER`, and the contract may not be an ERC-1967 proxy as it accesses a constant implementation slot not associated with the account, violating storage access rules. This also means that the owner of a `CordylineAccount` may not be another `CordylineAccount` if you want to send user operations through a bundler._

4. Improves gas estimation by enabling switching between `ecrecover` and ERC-1271 signature validation by prepending a `SignatureType` byte to the user operation signature. Allowed `SignatureType` values:

   - `SignatureType.EOA`: For an EOA owner. Signature is validated using `ecrecover`.
   - `SignatureType.CONTRACT`: For a contract owner. Signature is validated using `owner.isValidSignature`.

5. The factory uses Solady's `LibClone.createDeterministicERC1967` instead of OpenZeppelin's `ERC1967Proxy`.

6. The factory includes ownership and entry point staking capabilities to address mempool limitations for unstaked entities as defined in [ERC-7562](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7562).

7. Event `SimpleAccountInitialized` renamed to `CordylineAccountInitialized`.

8. Uses custom errors.

### `MultiOwnerCordylineAccount`

Like `CordylineAccount`, but with the following changes:

1. Multiple owners are supported. They can be specified at account deployment, or updated via `updateOwners`. This is a simple single-step operation, so care must be taken to ensure that the ownership is being updated to the correct address(es).

2. Allowed `SignatureType` values:

   - `SignatureType.EOA`: For EOA owners. Signature is validated using `ecrecover`.
   - `SignatureType.CONTRACT_WITH_ADDR`: For contract owners. Signature is validated using `owner.isValidSignature`. The contract owner address MUST be passed as part of the signature, following the format: `SignatureType.CONTRACT_WITH_ADDR || contractOwnerAddress || signature`, where `||` is the byte concatenation operator.

## Deployments

See the current deployments by network under the [deployments](./deployments) folder.

## Build

```bash
forge build
```

## Test

```bash
forge test -vvv
```

## Deploy

The deploy script supports any [wallet options](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-script#wallet-options---raw) provided by Foundry, including local private keys, mneumonics, hardware wallets, and remote signers. Append the chosen signing method's option to the field marked `[WALLET_OPTION]` in the following script command, and set the sender address in the field `[SENDER_ADDRESS]`.

```bash
forge script script/Deploy_CordylineAccountFactory.s.sol [WALLET_OPTION] --sender [SENDER_ADDRESS] --rpc-url [RPC_URL] -vvvv --broadcast --verify
forge script script/Deploy_MultiOwnerCordylineAccountFactory.s.sol [WALLET_OPTION] --sender [SENDER_ADDRESS] --rpc-url [RPC_URL] -vvvv --broadcast --verify
```

Make sure the provided `RPC_URL` is set to an RPC for the chain you wish to deploy on.

## Dependencies

Cordyline Smart Account uses dependencies via git submodules, pinned to release branches. Dependencies that cannot be reliably pinned (or those that needed to be modified) have been copied directly into the repository. These are listed below:
